## Game Rules
1. This game consists of the standard 52-card deck with 4 suits.
2. The play begins with the player, where he can either **hit** to draw a card or **stand** to pass the turn.
3. The dealer's hand is hidden and will be shown when the player **stand**.
4. If the player's sum of the hand is over 21 points, the player will bust and lose regardless of the dealers hand.
5. If the dealer goes over 21 points, the dealer will bust and the player will win.
6. The dealer will always draw if the sum of the hand is 16 or less.
7. The hand with the highest points, considering that no one has busted, will win.
8. It is considered a draw, when both hands are equal in points.
9. Aces will try to be 11 points, but will be changed to 1 points if the player or dealer will bust.
